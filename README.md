Module 3 | SDLC Assignment Part 2
1. Each patron in the system has a unique 7-digit ID number.  Each patron also has a name, address, and overdue fine amount, ranging anywhere from $0-$250.
2. Users must be able to add patrons to the LMS from a text file. 
3. Users must be able to manually enter the details of a new patron from the CLI.
4. Users must be able to remove patrons from the LMS using their ID  number.
5. Users must be able to see a list of all patrons currently in the LMS.
6. Users must interact with the system using an on-screen menu.
7. Data will be stored directly within the application; connection to a relational database is beyond the scope of work for this project.

The Purpose of this project is to develop a console-based library management system (LMS) to help librarians efficiently manage patron information that does not rely on database connectivity.
